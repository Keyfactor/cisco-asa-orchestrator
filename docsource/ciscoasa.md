## Overview

The CiscoAsa Certificate Store Type in Keyfactor Command enables the management of Identity Certificates and TrustPoints on Cisco Asa devices. This store type represents a specific configuration for handling certificates on these devices, including managing and binding certificates to interfaces for Remote Access VPN.

Keyfactor Command's use of the CiscoAsa Certificate Store Type facilitates various operations, such as inventorying certificates, adding new certificates, and removing certificates from the configured store on the Cisco Asa device. This store type is designed to interact with the Cisco Asa API, occasionally using the CLI through the API, which returns command line strings. This interaction can be fragile if the CLI commands change between different versions of the Cisco Asa software.

There are a few noteworthy caveats and limitations to keep in mind. The store type requires a server username and password with privilege level 15 to access the Cisco Asa API. Additionally, it's important to decide whether the operation should write to device memory only or commit changes to disk, affecting the persistence of changes after reboots. While the extension handles various common operations, users should be aware of these considerations to avoid potential issues when managing certificates.

## Requirements

The configuration of the CiscoAsa Universal Orchestrator extension requires specific settings and considerations. Follow these steps to ensure proper setup and functionality:

1. **Configure the Remote Platform (Cisco Asa) and API Access**:
   - Ensure that the Cisco Asa device is accessible over the network and that the API is enabled.
   - Verify that the device is running a compatible version of the Cisco Asa software.

2. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Create an account on the Cisco Asa device with privilege level 15 access.
   - Note the username and password for this account, as they will be required when setting up the Certificate Store in Keyfactor Command.

3. **Install the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator Extension for CiscoAsa**:
   - Deploy the Cisco Asa Universal Orchestrator extension on a server with access to both Keyfactor Command and the Cisco Asa device.

4. **Create the CiscoAsa Certificate Store Type**:
   - In Keyfactor Command, navigate to Certificate Store Types and create a new store type with the following basic and advanced settings:
     - **Name**: CiscoAsa
     - **Short Name**: CiscoAsa
     - **Supported Job Types**: Inventory, Add, Remove
     - **Needs Server**: Checked
     - **Blueprint Allowed**: Checked
     - **Store Path Type**: Freeform
     - **Supports Custom Alias**: Required
     - **Private Keys**: Required
     - **PFX Password Style**: Default or Custom

5. **Create the CiscoAsa Certificate Store**:
   - In Keyfactor Command, navigate to Certificate Stores and create a new store using the previously defined CiscoAsa Certificate Store Type.
   - Provide the following information during store creation:
     - **Category**: CiscoAsa
     - **Client Machine**: Hostname or IP of the Cisco Asa device
     - **Store Path**: /Identity
     - **Orchestrator**: Select the orchestrator with CiscoAsa capability
     - **Commit To Disk**: True or False based on your requirements
     - **Server Username**: The service account username
     - **Server Password**: The service account password
     - **Use SSL**: Determine whether to use SSL for API connection

By following these steps, you will ensure that the Cisco Asa device is properly configured for certificate management using the CiscoAsa Universal Orchestrator extension in Keyfactor Command.
