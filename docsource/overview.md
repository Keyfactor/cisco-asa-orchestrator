## Overview

The Cisco Asa Universal Orchestrator extension is designed to manage Identity Certificates and TrustPoints on Cisco Asa devices. This extension is equipped to handle certificate bindings on the Remote Access VPN for the managed certificates. Please note that some of the actions depend on using the CLI through the API, which may return command line strings that could change with different versions of the Cisco Asa software, potentially affecting the inventory bindings functionality.

In the context of Keyfactor Command, defined Certificate Stores of the Cisco Asa Certificate Store Type represent containers for managing certificates on Cisco Asa devices. These stores facilitate operations such as inventorying existing certificates, adding new certificates, and removing certificates from the device. They can be defined to manage certificates within specific paths or configurations specific to Cisco Asa devices, making the overall process of certificate management streamlined and efficient.
